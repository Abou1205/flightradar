# Flight Radar

The Flight Radar clone in React simplifies real-time flight tracking with an interactive map. It showcases live flight data, enabling users to pan, zoom, and filter by criteria like airline or altitude. This serves as a brief illustration for React developers delving into dynamic, API-driven applications for flight tracking.

## About

The Flight Radar project is a React-based application that mimics real-time flight tracking, utilizing a mapping library for dynamic display and user-friendly features like panning, zooming, and filtering. The application is designed for a seamless user experience, with a focus on adherence to API terms and optimization for performance.

## Technologies and Libraries

- **React:** Core library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Fligth API (RapidAPI):** Integration for fetching flights and details.
- **axios:** Handles HTTP requests for data fetching.
- **moment:** Manages and formats date and time.
- **react-router-dom:** Enables declarative routing within the app.
- **react-leaflet:** React library that seamlessly integrates with Leaflet, providing a declarative way to create interactive maps in React applications.
- **react-paginate:** React component library for easily implementing and customizing pagination in web applications.
- **bootstrap:** Utilized for styling and responsive design.
- **react-redux:** State management for a scalable and predictable state container.
- **redux-toolkit:** State management library for React applications.

## Flight API (RapidAPI)

The project utilizes the Flight API through RapidAPI to fetch flights and details. To use the Flight API, you will need to obtain a RapidAPI key.
